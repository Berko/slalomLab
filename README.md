## Run the app

     -  see if node and npm are installed
          - node -v
          - npm -v
     - go to https://nodejs.org/en/ to install.  dl LTS version.
          - install into default /usr/local
      - make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH
          - echo $PATH
      - CHECK usr/local permissions!
          - cd /usr
          - ls -l
          - if /usr/local is not owned by your user then you can’t install global node packages!
          - I did
               - sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local
          - better to do
               - mkdir ~/npm
               - npm config set prefix ~/npm
               - export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/npm/bin (this only updates the path for the open shell)!!!!
      - install npm dependencies
          - npm install
      - install global gulp
          - gulp —version
          - npm install -g gulp
     - install bower globally
          - npm install -g bower
    - install protractor globally
          - npm install -g protractor
          - webdriver-manager update
     - run the app
          - node server.js
     - run grunt dev watcher
